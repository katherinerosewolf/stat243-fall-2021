# Section 8: Thinking about simulation studies

We'll consider the simulation study in Section 4 of Cao et al. as an example of the kind of simulation
study that researchers set up to evaluate statistical and machine learning methods.

In particular, we'll discuss the goals of the simulation study, the choices made in determining how 
the simulated datasets were generated, what aspects of the data that the methodology
might be sensitive to, and how one interprets the tables showing the simulation results.

Our schedule for class today will be the following:

 - By yourself, try to write down pseudo-code giving the details of how the authors generate a simulated dataset in Section 4.1. (5 minutes)
 - In groups of 2-3, discuss your pseudo-code and your answers to question 5 of problem set 6. Write down your thoughts as a group on the google doc (link in Piazza post). In particular, consider the choices the authors made in generating the simulated datasets. Select a few you think 
 might be important and brainstorm how one might simulate the data differently. (15-20 minutes)
 - We will come back together and discuss these questions as a class (20 minutes)
