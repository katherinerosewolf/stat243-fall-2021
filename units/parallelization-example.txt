Dear Professor Paciorek,

I am an Economics PhD student currently working on a project that requires a lot of computational power.  I was wondering if you had any advice about at what level I should be parallelizing my code since it involves:

 - 5-fold cross-validation of a model that uses multiple threads to begin with
 - 100 iterations of that 5-fold cross-validation 
 - Randomization inference over the median statistic produced in the last 2 steps

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you,
...
